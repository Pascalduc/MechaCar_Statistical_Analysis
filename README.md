## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![LinRegSummary](Resources/LinRegSummary.png)


For this analysis we performed a linear regression to see if car variables, such as length and weight, affected the fuel efficiency in miles per gallon (mpg).

•	When looking at the Pr(>|t|) value, we see that the vehicle length and the ground clearancehave non-random amount of variance to the mpg values. This is due to p-values of 2.6e-12 and 5.2e-09 respectively, which is well below the 0.05 threshold to be considered to have a significant effect on fuel efficiency. Vehicle weight, with a p-value of 0.07, 

•	Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?

•	Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
